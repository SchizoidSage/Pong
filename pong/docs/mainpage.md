A Simple Pong Game

This is a simple Pong game as a test project to showcase the use of various game-related libraries, including [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl) and [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt). 
The code is structured according to the [ECS pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), using the EnTT registry for storing entities and components. SDL2 is used for window management, keyboard input and video output. OpenGL provides the graphics. Audio is provided through [OpenAL](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft).

## Controls
